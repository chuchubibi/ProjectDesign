                            <li>
                                Type "SCALE" in the command line and press Enter. The "Scale" dialog box will appear
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the "Scale" dialog box, you can set the scale factor that you want to use for your drawing. The scale factor represents the ratio between the size of the objects in your drawing and their real-world size. For example, if you set a scale factor of 1:50, each unit in your drawing represents 50 units in real life
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You can also choose whether to apply the scale to the entire drawing or to a specific selection of objects
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once you have set the desired scale, click "OK" to save the settings.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        By setting the model scale in AutoCAD, you can ensure that your drawing accurately represents the real-world size and proportions of the objects and elements that you are drawing. This is important for tasks such as architectural and engineering design, where accurate scaling is essential
